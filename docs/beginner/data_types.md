### Must Know

#### 1. `Symbol`

**Just ignore it**. You will hardly use it anywhere, and yes you can learn it anytime you need it.

#### 2. Why do we need both `undefined` and `null`?

While `null` and `undefined` are sometimes used interchangeably, they serve different purposes:

- **undefined:** The value of a variable or object property that has not been assigned, or does not exist.
- **null:** An explicit assignment indicating "no value." The variable or property exists, but is intentionally set to have no value.
