# JS Comments

Comments are lines of code that JavaScript ignores. They help explain your code to other developers (and your future self!).

## Single-line Comments
Use `//` for single-line comments:

```javascript
// This is a comment
let name = "John"; // Comment at end of line
```

## Multi-line Comments
Use `/* */` for multi-line comments:

```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment
that spans several lines
*/
let age = 25;
```

That's it! Comments make your code readable and maintainable.
